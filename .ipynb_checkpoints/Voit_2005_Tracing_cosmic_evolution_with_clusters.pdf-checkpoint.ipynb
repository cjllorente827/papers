    "# Notes on <i>Tracing cosmic evolution with clusters of galaxies<i> by Mark Voit (2005)\n",

    "Galaxy clusters are the loargest objects that have had time to collapse under gravity. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Two features of clusters make them uniquely useful tracers of cosmic evolution.\n",
    "    - They are the biggest structures who's masses can be reliably measured\n",
    "    - Clusters contain all their gaseous matter since their potential wells are so deep.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The purpose of this article is to review a theoretical understanding of the dark matter and baryonic component of clusters, provide a context for interpreting new cluster observations from x-ray observations, large optical surveys, and cluster-induced distortions in the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background. \n",
    "    \n",
    "According to the <i>concordance model</i> the geometry of the observable universe is indistinguishable from a flat geometry, i.e. total energy density is close to the critical density required for a closed universe. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to virial theorem, the mass of a spherical, isolated cluster (with particles that have a Gaussian velocity distribution with dispersion $\\sigma$) is \n",
    "    \n",
    "$$\n",
    "M = \\frac{3 \\sigma^2 r_G }{G}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "The rate at which the ICM radiates energy can be expressed in terms of a cooling function $\\Lambda (T)$. Since cooling processes all involve electrons colliding with ions, cooling functions are defined as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Lambda (T) = n_e n_{ion} \\tilde\\Lambda (T) \\sim n^2 \\tilde\\Lambda (T)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "where $\\tilde\\Lambda$ is the cooling luminosity per unit volume. \"Cooling goes as number density squared\""
